Info:
We have only web-platform (site http://testix.me).
We don't have english localization yet. I haven't found that rule on facebook review instructions. 

Why we need it.
Using Testix editor users can design many types of interactive content including Facebook 360 panoramas. 'Publish_actions' permission will allow users to upload panoramas on Facebook.

Instructions: using 'publish_actions' permission.
1) Go to on site in templates list 'https://testix.me/storefront'.
2) You can see item 'Facebook панорамы' in left menu. Click it.
3) You see templates for Facebook 360. Select one, click 'Редактировать' (Edit)
4) First login our site. Standart login, no extended permissions aren't needed.
5) You see template image for your project.
6) Click 'Опубликовать' (Publish) in top right corner.
7) Next you will see dialog, that explains why we need extended permissions 'publish_actions'. You can continue (Продолжить) or cancel (Отмена)
8) After that Facebook popup emerges.
9) Our final popup.
10) You can see panorama on your timeline.
